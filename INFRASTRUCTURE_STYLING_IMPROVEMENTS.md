# Infrastructure Layer Visualization Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Reduced Line Width for Better Clarity**
- **Railway Lines**: Reduced from 4px to 1px width
- **Roads**: Reduced from 4px to 0.8px width  
- **Rivers**: Reduced from 3px to 0.8px width

### 2. **Subtle Color Adjustments**
- **Railway Lines**: Changed to brown (#8B4513) with dashed pattern
- **Roads**: Changed to peru color (#CD853F) for subtlety
- **Rivers**: Changed to steel blue (#4682B4) with lighter fill

### 3. **Layer Ordering (Z-Index) Optimization**
- **Rivers**: Z-index 3 (bottom layer)
- **Roads**: Z-index 4  
- **Railway**: Z-index 5
- **Schools & Anganwadis**: Higher z-index (stay on top)

### 4. **Updated Legend**
- Infrastructure section now labeled "Infrastructure (Subtle)"
- Legend lines made thinner to match actual rendering
- Railway shows dashed pattern in legend
- Reduced font size and lighter color for infrastructure labels

## Benefits

### Visual Clarity
- **School points are now the primary focus** - red dots clearly visible
- **Anganwadi centers stand out** - green dots prominent
- **Infrastructure serves as context** - visible but not overwhelming

### Gap Analysis Enhancement
- **Critical gaps more visible** - red indicators stand out against subtle infrastructure
- **Distance analysis clearer** - buffer zones and connections easier to see
- **Obstacle identification** - infrastructure still visible for analysis but not distracting

### Professional Appearance
- **Clean, government-standard visualization**
- **Balanced information hierarchy** - education facilities prioritized
- **Improved readability** for reports and presentations

## Visual Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)
1. **Gap Analysis Alerts** (Highest priority - red indicators)
2. **School Points** (Primary data - red dots)  
3. **Anganwadi Centers** (Primary data - green dots)
4. **Buffer Zones** (Analysis results)
5. **Connection Lines** (Analysis results)
6. **Administrative Boundaries** (District/Village)
7. **Infrastructure** (Context - railways, roads, rivers)
8. **Base Map** (Background)

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimization
- Thin lines render faster
- Lower z-index reduces rendering conflicts
- Maintained all analytical functionality

### Analytical Capabilities Preserved
- Infrastructure still detected for obstacle analysis
- All gap analysis functionality intact
- Export and reporting capabilities maintained

### User Experience
- Cleaner visual interface
- Focus on educational infrastructure priorities
- Professional government reporting standards

*These changes ensure that school points and anganwadi centers are the primary focus while maintaining infrastructure context for comprehensive analysis.*
