# Fixed Initial Layer Loading Issue

## Problem
Red school points were loading automatically when the application started, even before selecting a district.

## Root Cause
The school layer had hardcoded visibility set to `true` in the PreschoolMapView component:
```tsx
// Always show school points (red dots)
layer.setVisible(true);
```

This was overriding the `layersVisibility.schools: false` setting from the initial state.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed School Layer Visibility**
**Before:**
```tsx
// Always show school points (red dots)
layer.setVisible(true);
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Show school points only when enabled in layersVisibility
layer.setVisible(!!layersVisibility.schools);
```

### 2. **Set Infrastructure Layers to Initially Hidden**
Updated initial `layersVisibility` state for cleaner startup:
```tsx
const [layersVisibility, setLayersVisibility] = useState({
  state: true,      // Show state boundary
  district: true,   // Show district boundaries
  village: false,   // Hidden until district selected
  anganwadi: false, // Hidden until district selected
  gap: false,       // Hidden until analysis run
  schools: false,   // Hidden until district selected
  rail: false,      // Hidden initially (user can enable)
  river: false,     // Hidden initially (user can enable)
  road: false,      // Hidden initially (user can enable)
});
```

### 3. **Maintained Proper Workflow**
The existing workflow is preserved:
1. **Application Start**: Only state and district boundaries visible
2. **District Selection**: Automatically enables village, anganwadi, and schools layers
3. **User Choice**: Infrastructure layers can be toggled on/off as needed
4. **Gap Analysis**: Results appear when analysis is performed

## Benefits

### Clean Initial View
- **Uncluttered startup**: Only administrative boundaries visible
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, focused interface
- **Better performance**: Fewer layers loaded initially

### Logical Progressive Disclosure
- **Step 1**: Select district → See boundaries
- **Step 2**: System loads → Educational facilities appear
- **Step 3**: Toggle infrastructure → Context layers available
- **Step 4**: Run analysis → Gap results displayed

### User Control
- **Infrastructure layers optional**: Users choose what context to display
- **Educational focus**: Primary data (schools/anganwadis) appears with district selection
- **Clear workflow**: Guided progression through analysis steps

## Technical Implementation

### Layer Loading Sequence
1. **Map initialization**: Base map + administrative boundaries
2. **District selection trigger**: Educational facility layers enabled
3. **Data loading**: WFS services fetch school and anganwadi data
4. **User interaction**: Infrastructure layers available on demand
5. **Analysis execution**: Gap analysis results overlay

### Performance Optimization
- **Reduced initial load**: Fewer WFS requests at startup
- **On-demand loading**: Infrastructure data loaded only when needed
- **Efficient rendering**: Minimal initial layer stack

### State Management
- **Consistent visibility control**: All layers respect layersVisibility state
- **Proper cleanup**: Clear function resets to initial state
- **Reactive updates**: Layer visibility responds to state changes

## Current Application Flow

**🎯 Clean Start** → **📍 Select District** → **🏫 Schools Load** → **🔍 Run Analysis** → **📊 View Results**

This ensures users see a logical progression from general administrative view to detailed educational infrastructure analysis, with school points appearing only when relevant data is being analyzed.
